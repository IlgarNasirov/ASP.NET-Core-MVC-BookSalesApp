This is a book sales web project. There are admins and users pages. The admins can do all CRUD operations on genres and books. For adding books you have to choose 
genre. The admins can also follow total sales, users, today's total sales values and the most popular genres chart. Unauthenticated users can just look at and look for books. Authenticated users can add to checkout their favourite books and delete from there. They can also buy books which located in the checkout. After that you can download your books. You need to add SQL backup file to your Microsoft SQL Server application for using this project. I used ASP.NET Core 
Identity(for authentication and authorization), bcrypt(for hashing password), Serilog(for logging), Entity Framework Core(as ORM framework) with database first approach, Microsoft SQL Server(as database), jQuery(for client side validation) and so on.
